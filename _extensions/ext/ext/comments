Building a website with a dashboard functions well

`_quarto.yml:`
````yml
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "test"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: dashboard.qmd
        text: Dashboard
      - about.qmd

format:
  html: 
    theme: cosmo
````

`index.qmd`
````qmd
---
title: "test"
---

This is a Quarto website.

```{r}
1 + 1
```
````

`dashboard.qmd`
````qmd
---
format:
  dashboard: default
---
## Row
::: {.valuebox title="title" color="green"}
42
:::

::: {.valuebox title="title" color="orange"}
76
:::
````

a random `about.qmd`

But if I use an extension, in 

`_extension/ext/ext/_extension.yml` with a scss file setting some elements (as a matter of fact it is not needed)
````yml
title: myext
author: me
version: 0.1.0
quarto-required: ">=1.6.3"
contributes:
  formats:
    html:
      theme: 
        - cosmo
        - myscss.scss
      mainfont: Open Sans
      toc-location: left
      lightbox: true
      title-block-style: default
````

and then use the folowing `_quarto.yml`, then the styling works everywhere except on the dashboard
````yml
project:
  type: website
website:
  title: "test"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: dashboard.qmd
        text: Dashboard
      - about.qmd
format:
  ext-html: 
    theme: cosmo
